This dress is beautiful with gorgeous coloring, nice thick, stretchy fabric and wonderful detailing including buttons. the only issue i had with it is that it's does run small, especially in the bust. i'm normally a medium to large, depending on cut so after reading the previous reviews, i ordered a large and it's pretty snug. still deciding whether i will keep or try for an xl, which is doubtful in availability at this point. i ordered it with two other pieces, both of those a medium fit fine.",1

I bought the delaney blazer in size 6 -- and i really like it. there are surprising design elements which make it a unique piece -- the buttons of the sleeves are mismatched, the back material is different from the front, it has some exposed seams. like others have said it does have a boxy fit -- which i don't mind. i also found it to be a bit short. if both of these things are fine for you, the blazer is a great addition to a casual-creative professional look.",1

This looked beautiful online, but the skirt isn't 100% silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels, with most of them containing some level of polyester. parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch, and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap. overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online.

I hoped, from the picture, that this would be more of a ""straight down"" sort of fit. retailer is usually really great at selling tops that flatter hips without having an obvious bell shape to them. however, the top had too much of a ""flare out"" bell-shaped vibe. i need to be able to wear this with maxi skirts in the summer, but this top would be too sack-like and billowy with those. i think it would only work with jeans/trousers. my final objection was the arm holes - the way they are cut,",0
